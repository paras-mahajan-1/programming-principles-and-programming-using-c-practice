    cout << "1. Blueberries\n";
    cout << "--Use fresh or frozen blueberries in this recipe. If you use frozen, add them frozen so your batter doesn’t turn purple.\n";
    cout << "2. Flour\n";
    cout << "-- I use all-purpose flour in the video, but this recipe works with whole wheat flour, spelt flour, and even an all-purpose gluten-free flour blend (like Bob’s Red Mill). I use whole wheat flour when making these banana blueberry muffins.\n";
    cout << "3. Sugar\n";
    cout << "--Sugar: To keep these light and airy, I use granulated sugar. You can swap for other sugars (brown sugar or coconut sugar, for example), but the texture will change slightly. I also love adding a sprinkle of sugar to the muffin tops just before baking, which turns into a crackly top.\n";
    cout << "4. Oil\n";
    cout << "--Oil: It keeps our muffins light and moist in the middle, and I consider it one of the secrets to the best blueberry muffins. I have tested this recipe with butter, and while it tastes great, the oil still makes more tender muffins.\n";
    cout << "5. Milk\n";
    cout << "--Milk or Non-Dairy Milk: Both work for this recipe, so use what you have. I have made these muffins with homemade oat milk, unsweetened almond milk, and coconut milk (carton, not canned) with great results.\n";
    cout << "6. Egg\n";
    cout << "--Adds structure and flavor to our muffins. If you do not eat eggs, use one flax egg. Or try these vegan blueberry muffins.\n";
    cout << "7. Baking powder\n";
    cout << "--Baking powder: Keeps our muffins light and airy. Use recently purchased double-acting baking powder (it lasts about 3 months). If you are sensitive to the flavor of baking powder, make sure that yours is aluminum-free (I like Bob’s Red Mill).\n";

    cout << "How to Make Blueberry Muffins:-\n";
    cout << "You will need\n";
    cout << "1(1/2)cups (195) all purpose flour, spooned and leveled\n";
    cout << "3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for muffin\n";
    cout << "2 teaspoons baking powder, we prefer aluminium-free\n";
    cout << "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n";
    cout << "1/3 cup (80ml) milk or non-dairy milk\n";
    cout << "1(1/2) teaspoons vanilla extract\n";
    cout << "6 to 8 ounces fresh or frozen blueberries, generous 1 cup\n";
    cout << "-----------------------------------------\n";
    cout << "Directions:-\n";
    cout << "1. Preheat oven and prep pan: Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Line muffin cups with paper liners (8 for big muffins, 10 for standard, or 22 for mini muffins). Lightly grease or spray the tops of the muffin tin with oil to prevent the oversized tops from sticking (high-quality nonstick pans may not require this).\n";
    cout << "2. Prepare the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n";
    cout << "3. Prepare the wet ingredients: Choose a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup. Add the oil to the jug, and then crack in the egg. Pour in enough milk to reach the 1-cup line on the jug (this should be about 1/3 cup of milk). Add the vanilla extract and whisk until everything is combined.\n";
    cout << "4. Make the batter: Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently until the batter comes together. Gently fold in the blueberries. Be careful not to overmix! The batter will be thick (see tips below).\n";
    cout << "5. Bake the muffins: Divide the batter between muffin cups. If making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners. Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin. Bake muffins for 15 to 20 minutes or until the tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.\n";
    cout << "------------------------------------------\n";
    cout << "Measuring your flour: Fluff the flour in its container, then gently scoop it into your measuring cup until slightly mounded. Then, level off the top with a knife for accurate measuring. Or, use a scale and measure the flour by weight (in grams) for even more accuracy.\n";
    cout << "Frozen blueberries: Add frozen blueberries while frozen, do not thaw them.\n";
    cout << "Using different fruits: Yes, you can use other fruits! Replace the blueberries with a similar amount (approximately 1 to 1 ¼ cups of fruits like raspberries, blackberries, or finely chopped peaches. Remember to add frozen fruit while still frozen! See our peach muffins and strawberry muffins as examples!\n";
    cout << "Batter thickness: The batter should be thick and “scoopable” — not runny and not dry or extra thick like dough. If the batter is too runny, add flour, a tablespoon at a time, until the consistency is correct. If the batter is dry or too thick, add milk a tablespoon at a time until it has the proper consistency.\n";
    cout << "For mini blueberry muffins: This recipe makes 20 to 22 mini muffins. The baking time will be less — keep an eye on them while they bake and expect them to take 9 to 11 minutes.\n";
    cout << "Storing: Place the room-temperature muffins into an airtight container and store them at room temperature for up to 3 days. To freeze, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil or store them in freezer bags. Freeze for up to 3 months.\n";
    cout << "Recipe inspired by Allrecipes blueberry muffins.\n";
    cout << "The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. Calculations are for one standard muffin (this recipe makes 10).\n";

    cout << "Terms:-\n";
    cout << "Muffin pan:- A muffin pan is a baking pan with a grid of connected, cup-shaped molds used to bake individual portions of items like muffins, cupcakes, or other small treats.\n";
    cout << "Preheating is heating something beforehand, typically an oven or a metal, to reach a specific temperature before use\n";
    cout << "An oven is a heated, enclosed space used for cooking food.\n";
